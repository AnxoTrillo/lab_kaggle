    "- Por otro lado, se aplicó la técnica de stacking, donde las predicciones de varios modelos base se utilizan como entrada de un metamodelo. Esta estrategia permitió aprovechar la diversidad de modelos entrenados (KNN, Random Forest, modelos de boosting, etc.) para obtener una combinación óptima de sus predicciones.\n",

    "Para construir las primeras versiones del sistema ensemble, se preparó un conjunto de modelos base representativos y diversos. Estos incluyeron tanto algoritmos clásicos (como KNeighborsRegressor o Ridge) como modelos más complejos basados en árboles (RandomForest, HistGradientBoosting) y redes neuronales (MLPRegressor). El objetivo era que el conjunto cubriese distintos tipos de relaciones y escalas presentes en los datos.\n",

    "El primer metamodelo utilizado fue una regresión lineal (LinearRegression), que combinaba las predicciones de los modelos base sin boosting. \n",

    "Finalmente, se exploró una estrategia basada en duplicar los modelos más competitivos, entrenándolos con diferentes valores de semilla. Esta técnica permitió aprovechar la diversidad que se puede obtener incluso dentro del mismo tipo de modelo, mejorando la capacidad del ensemble para generalizar sobre nuevos datos. En total, se utilizaron 17 modelos base. A partir de estos modelos, se implementó una arquitectura de stacking manual con passthrough, donde las predicciones generadas por cada modelo base fueron combinadas junto con las características originales escaladas y utilizadas como entrada para un metamodelo. Este metamodelo fue un StackingRegressor compuesto a su vez por cinco estimadores (incluyendo redes neuronales, regresión lineal, Random Forest y Gradient Boosting), y con una regresión lineal como estimador final.\n",

    "Al incorporar modelos que utilizasen boosting se logró reducir aún más el MAE a 28228. Buscando aumentar la precisión, se optimizaron los parámetros de los modelos internos, logrando una leve mejora. Por último, el mejor resultado fue obtenido por un stack que incorporó también passthrough, haciendo que la entrada consistiese en las predicciones generadas por cada modelo base combinadas junto con las características originales. Esto permitió alcanzar un MAE en Kaggle de 28127.734, convirtiéndose en nuestra mejor entrega que nos permitió finalizar en 2ª posición en el ranking público."

    "\n",
    "En primer lugar, la utilidad de los ensembles en comparación a modelos individuales. Si bien modelos de ensemble como el bagging pueden verse influenciados por la calidad de los regresores que usemos, modelos como el stacking o blending hacen que las diferencias de sus propios modelos internos sean los puntos fuertes del resultado final. De este modo modo, es casi irrelevante si un modelo no es óptimo, puesto que lo importante para nosotros será si ha sido capaz de encontrar una cualidad sobre el dataset que el resto de modelos no, y que el metamodelo pondrá en juego en el momento de hacer las predicciones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Los modelos de boosting son extremadamente eficaces debido a mejorar sus propios resultados durante varias fases antes de devolverlos al metamodelo, como se puede ver en la mejora de los stacks que incluyen a este tipo de modelos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Como propósito de mejora puede quedar la aplicación de un modelo de blending completo, debido a que el de la práctica utiliza PassThrough en lugar de un segmento de Holdout de los datos de partida. Aún así, esto no asegura una mejora de los resultados, debido a la posibilidad de sobreentrenamiento que supone usar secciones de Holdout pequeñas, y el empeoramiento del entrenamiento que supone reducir el dataset de los modelos iniciales."
