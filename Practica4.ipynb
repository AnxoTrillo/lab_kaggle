    "Para construir las primeras versiones del sistema ensemble, se preparó un conjunto de modelos base representativos y diversos. Estos incluyeron tanto algoritmos clásicos (como KNeighborsRegressor o Ridge) como modelos más complejos basados en árboles (RandomForest, HistGradientBoosting) y redes neuronales (MLPRegressor). El objetivo era que el conjunto cubriese distintos tipos de relaciones y escalas presentes en los datos.\n",
    "\n",
    "El primer metamodelo utilizado fue una regresión lineal (LinearRegression), que combinaba las predicciones de los modelos base sin boosting. También se probó una arquitectura de stacking más sofisticada, utilizando un MLPRegressor como metamodelo. Esta estructura logró mejorar el rendimiento, alcanzando un MAE de 28889.4232 en su mejor versión inicial."
